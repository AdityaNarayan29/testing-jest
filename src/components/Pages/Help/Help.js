			<h1>Help Component</h1>
			<p>
				The Help component plays a crucial role in enhancing the user experience
				and providing assistance within the application. It serves as a valuable
				resource for users to find relevant information, troubleshoot issues,
				and learn how to navigate through the application.
			</p>
			<p>
				With its intuitive user interface, the Help component ensures that users
				can easily access the necessary documentation, FAQs, tutorials, and
				other support materials. It is designed to be user-friendly, providing
				clear and concise instructions to address common questions or problems.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Help component can be accessed from various parts of the
				application, either as a standalone page or as a floating widget,
				depending on the design and requirements. It can be triggered by
				clicking on a dedicated Help button or through keyboard shortcuts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, the Help component can be customized to fit the overall
				visual theme of the application. It can include branding elements, such
				as the application logo or color scheme, to provide a consistent look
				and feel.
			</p>
			<p>
				By incorporating the Help component, we create an inclusive and
				user-centric application that empowers users to seek assistance whenever
				needed. It promotes self-service and reduces the dependency on external
				support channels, leading to improved user satisfaction and overall
				productivity.
